To make a paper airplane, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. Take an 8.5 x 11 inch sheet of paper.
2. Fold the paper lengthwise and crease it in the middle.
3. Unfold the paper and fold the top two corners inward by about 1/3 of the paper's length, creasing the folds.
4. Fold the paper in half, aligning the edges and creases.
5. Fold the top point down about 1/2 inch from the top edge, and fold the bottom point up about 1/2 inch from the bottom edge.
6. Fold the wings down by bringing the top corners inward and creasing them
