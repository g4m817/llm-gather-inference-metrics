Sure, the water cycle, also known as the hydrologic cycle, is the continuous movement of water on, above, and below Earth's surface. It's a fundamental process that supplies water for all forms of life. The cycle starts when water evaporates from the ocean, lakes, and rivers, and rises into the atmosphere as water vapor. Then, it condenses into invisible water droplets around particles of dust, forming clouds. When the conditions are right, these clouds release the water back to the earth's surface as precipitation, in the form of rain, snow, hail or sleet. Once the precipitation reaches the surface, it may either flow into rivers, lakes and oceans or be absorbed into the ground to become
